Dear Reader,

That you for purchasing my book. This directory contains the source code
and data for the examples in my book.

When I wrote the examples for this book I created an Amazon EC2 AMI with
the examples installed and running (as described in Appendix A). This AMI
is very out of date and I suggest that you not try to use it.

I also suggest that you skip the old Rails demo programs in Part 4 of the book
for reasons that I document on the errata web page for this book
(http://markwatson.com/books/web3_book/).

The code in Parts 1, 2, and 3 of the book, while old, should still be relevant and useful.
Almost all of the code is Ruby (with some Java Hadoop example code) and has useful
utilities for Natural Language Processing (NLP), semantic web, accessing both relational
and NoSQL type data sotres, etc.

There are subdirectories for each part of my book. I did not separate the examples
into directories for individual chapters because sometimes examples for different
chapters in a book part share libraries and data.

Each subdirectory also contains a README.txt file. Many of the examples require
other software (usually open source) to run - these dependencies, with download
links, are listed in the book. The README.txt files in the book part subdirectories
contain information for running the examples in the same order as the material
appears in the book.

I appreciate hearing from readers of my books if they have specific
problems running any of the example programs. I try to resolve their issues
and place new HOW-TO information on the errata page for my books.  The most
current information for this book will be kept at: http://markwatson.com/books/web3_book/
This link also will point you to information and resources on the APress
web site.

Here is a summary of the table of contents for the book:

PART 1 Text Processing: Natural Language Processing, Parsing Common Document Types,
  Cleaning, Segmenting, and Spell-Checking Text

PART 2 The Semantic Web: Using RDF and RDFS Data Formats, Delving Into RDF Data Stores,

PART 3 Information Gathering and Storage: Relational Databases, Indexing and Search,
  Using Web Scraping to Create Semantic Relations, Strategies for Large-Scale Data Storage

PART 4 Information Publishing: Creating Web Mashups, Performing Large-Scale Data Processing,
  Building Information Web Portals
  
Best regards,
Mark Watson
